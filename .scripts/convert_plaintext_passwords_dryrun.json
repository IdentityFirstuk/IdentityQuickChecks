The repository uses helper ConvertTo-SecureStringIfNeeded and SecureString/PSCredential parameters in high-impact scripts. No automated replacements proposed. Recommend manual review of environment-variable fallbacks (IFQC_DEV_PFX_PASSWORD) and documenting secure usage.",

    "If you want automated replacement for developer env var conversion, I can add a small helper that centralizes env->SecureString conversion and replace local loops.",
